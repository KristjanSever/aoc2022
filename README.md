My solutions to the Advent of Code 2022

I will attempt to solve all puzzles in Ruby. The primary objective is to solve them, the secondary is to make them readable (if I feel like it).

File name explanation:
* `input.txt` input for the puzzle.
* `test_input.txt` input for the testing (usually the puzzle explanation example)
* `task(<1|2>).<extension>` code for the task. If file name doesnt contain numbers both tasks are solved in the same file.

Tasks after day 15 are unreadable for now. Might fix them later.
The only "non programming" solution is the day 17 task 2, where i ran the program to find the period of the occurances, changed the parameters a bit and solved it by hand
