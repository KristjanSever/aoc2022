My solutions to the Advent of Code 2022

I will attempt to solve all puzzles in Ruby and JavaScript. The primary objective is to solve them, the secondary is to make them readable (if I feel like it).

File name explanation:
* `input.txt` input for the puzzle.
* `test_input.txt` input for the testing (usually the puzzle explanation example)
* `task(<1|2>).<extension>` code for the task. If file name doesnt contain numbers both tasks are solved in the same file.
